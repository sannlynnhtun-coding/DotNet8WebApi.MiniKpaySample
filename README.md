# DotNet8WebApi.MiniKpaySample

In the DotNet8WebApi.MiniKpaySample project, a common pattern used is the **Result Pattern**. This pattern is used to handle and encapsulate the outcomes of operations, particularly in scenarios involving potential errors or exceptional conditions. It typically involves:

- **Result Object:** Encapsulates the success or failure state of an operation.
- **Success/Failure Handling:** Differentiates between successful outcomes and errors.
- **Error Messages:** Provides meaningful error messages or codes.

This approach improves the robustness and readability of the code, making error handling more consistent and easier to manage.
